# My Weekly Workout Routine

Here's my current workout schedule that balances strength training and cardiovascular exercise.

## Weekly Schedule

- **Monday**: Upper body strength
- **Tuesday**: Cardio (running/cycling)
- **Wednesday**: Lower body strength
- **Thursday**: Active recovery (yoga/stretching)
- **Friday**: Full body HIIT
- **Saturday**: Outdoor activities
- **Sunday**: Rest day

## Key Principles

- Progressive overload
- Proper form over heavy weights
- Adequate rest and recovery
- Consistent nutrition

This is just a sample post to demonstrate the structure. You can replace this with your actual content.
