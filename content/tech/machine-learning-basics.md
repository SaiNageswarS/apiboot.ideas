# Machine Learning Basics

Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and make decisions from data without being explicitly programmed.

## Key Concepts

- **Supervised Learning**: Learning with labeled data
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Finding patterns in unlabeled data
- **Deep Learning**: Neural networks with multiple layers

## Applications

- Image recognition
- Natural language processing
- Recommendation systems
- Predictive analytics

This is just a sample post to demonstrate the structure. You can replace this with your actual content.
