When I was 23, I developed an inguinal hernia on the left side of my groin while doing overhead presses in the gym.

At first, it was very painful and hard to get the bulge in. A little research revealed it was a hernia — and everything online said hernia = surgery. I also read that after surgery, one should avoid lifting weights. That was discouraging, so I stopped training altogether.

However, over time, the hernia kept coming out more easily, and a gentle push would slide it back in.
After a little over two months, when it became easy for the hernia to slide in, I cautiously started lifting weights again.

## The Second Blow
A year later, in the year 2012, I joined IIT Madras for my M.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering. I was living in the hostel and was having pretty hectic academic schedule. I continued working out in campus gym atleast 3 times a week. 

One day, again after overhead presses, another hernia developed on the right side of my groin. This time, it was even more painful to get the bulge in. The right one however, won't slide back in easily and I have to lie down hours before it will slide back in. Further, everytime right hernia comes out, left hernia would also comes out. It used to be very painful everytime it happened. 

It seemed surgery was inevitable. However, it was difficult to take break from the academics. Masters involved two semesters of coursework and two semesters of research. Every hour was precious. 

I managed classes and research, wearing tight underwear and walking very slowly. Seemed life came to an end as I was used to live an active life. Even after every precaution, both hernias would slide out in hours with right one causing lot of pain.

## Turning to Yoga

Instead of giving up, I decided to try yoga. I began practicing two poses regularly:
- Sarvangasana (Shoulder Stand)
- Navasana (Boat Pose)
